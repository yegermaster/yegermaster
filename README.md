ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yegermaster
Iâ€™m interested in software development, cognitive science and machine learning.
Iâ€™m currently learning more about machine learning and diffrent computing technologies.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that i can imporve and learn any new concepts from.
If you're working on applications or tools and you need a hand, I'd love to contribute - itamaryeger3@gmail.com
